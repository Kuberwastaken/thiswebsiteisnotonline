` : ''}
CONCEPT INTERPRETATION: 
Analyze "${path}" and create a website that perfectly matches what this concept should be:
- Is it a business, hobby site, meme, service, entertainment, art project, etc.?
- What audience would visit this? (professionals, kids, gamers, general public, etc.)
- What era/style fits? (90s personal site, modern startup, retro gaming, corporate, fun/quirky, etc.)
- Match the design and content to what makes sense for this specific concept

üö´ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- RETURN ONLY HTML CODE - no explanations, questions, or markdown
- Always generate the complete website immediately  
- Never ask permission or describe what you'll make
- Start immediately with <!DOCTYPE html>

üéØ CONTENT & DESIGN MATCHING:

FOR PROFESSIONAL/BUSINESS CONCEPTS (law firms, medical, consulting, etc.):
- Clean, professional layouts with structured sections
- Conservative color schemes (blues, grays, whites) but still polished
- Comprehensive content: services, pricing, testimonials, FAQ, contact info
- 6-8 sections with detailed business information
- Make it feel established and trustworthy

FOR FUN/CREATIVE/MEME CONCEPTS (hobbies, entertainment, quirky ideas):
- Bold, creative designs with personality
- Bright colors, gradients, fun fonts, creative layouts
- Interactive elements, games, or unique features
- 3-5 highly engaging sections focused on entertainment
- Embrace the weird and wonderful - make it memorable!

FOR NICHE/SPECIALTY CONCEPTS:
- Theme heavily around the specific topic
- Use appropriate visual language for that niche
- Include authentic terminology and passionate details
- Make it feel like it was created by a true enthusiast

üö´ NO GENERIC WEBSITES:
- NEVER use boring white backgrounds with plain black text
- Every site needs strong visual personality matching its concept
- Fun sites: Use bold themes (neon, retro, cyberpunk, rainbow, space, gaming aesthetics)
- Professional sites: Sophisticated but distinctive styling that stands out
- Match colors, fonts, and layout to the concept's natural personality

üîó NAVIGATION & LINKING:
- Include multiple buttons and links throughout the site
- Link to related sub-pages like "${path}/about", "${path}/contact", "${path}/help", "${path}/services"
- Add creative cross-links to completely different concepts like "/unicorns", "/mystery", "/adventure", "/pizza"
- Make navigation feel like a real interconnected website with many pages to explore
- Include "Random Page" buttons that link to unexpected concepts

üìê LAYOUT & STRUCTURE:
- Choose layout that best fits the concept (don't force sidebars on fun sites!)
- Professional sites: Structured navigation, clear sections, organized content
- Creative sites: Flexible layouts, creative navigation, unique organization
- Include appropriate navigation and sections for the type of site
- Make the layout serve the content and concept, not the other way around

‚ö° INTERACTIVE FEATURES:
- Add smooth hover effects, transitions, and animations
- Include functional-looking buttons, forms, and navigation
- Create engaging micro-interactions throughout
- All links should point to realistic sub-pages or related sites

üö´ TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- NO IMAGES (no <img>, background-image, or any image references)
- Use CSS shapes, gradients, borders, emojis, Unicode symbols for all visuals
- Only return HTML - no explanations or markdown
- Make it content-heavy and comprehensive (aim for 4000+ characters of actual content)
- All content must be unique, realistic, and specific to the path name

Make it feel like a real, established website that's been online for years with tons of content and regular updates!`;
